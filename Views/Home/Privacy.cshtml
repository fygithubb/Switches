<h2>About the Developer</h2>

<p>Hey there! I’m <strong>Anas Anjum Khan</strong>, a detail-oriented software developer based in Mumbai, currently exploring the world of full-stack development through hands-on projects and professional experience.</p>

<p>I have worked as a Software Development Intern at <strong>Marcus Evans</strong>, where I helped build and maintain internal enterprise tools across global teams. From CRM modernization to building APIs and Razor Pages in .NET Core, I’ve worked closely with stakeholders in the UAE, UK, US, and APAC regions to streamline processes and ensure data integrity.</p>

<p>This puzzle game was built as a side project to deepen my understanding of clean architecture and ASP.NET Core MVC. The game logic is inspired by algorithmic puzzles I enjoy solving on <a href="https://leetcode.com/u/anaskhanreign/" target="_blank">LeetCode</a>, and it’s powered by service-based architecture, Razor Pages, and simple stateful logic using C#.</p>

<p>My goal was to make something fun, interactive, and rooted in logic—like many of the coding challenges I enjoy. I plan to add difficulty levels, scoreboards, and maybe even multiplayer logic in the future. Stay tuned!</p>

<p><strong>Tech Stack Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>ASP.NET Core MVC (8.0)</li>
    <li>C# Services with Razor Pages</li>
    <li>State Management and Clean Architecture</li>
    <li>Bootstrap for responsive layout</li>
    <li>Deployed locally via IIS (Please don't mind this I tried with Hosting it turns out I dont have enough money to buy a domain..')</li>
</ul>
